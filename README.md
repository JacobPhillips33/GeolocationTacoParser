# Geolocation - TacoParser

C# Console Application

Provided a CSV file containing Taco Bell locations in Alabama, this application will 
determine which two Taco Bell's are farthest apart and provide their distance apart in 
miles. It accomplishes this by parsing through the CSV file for each location's latitude 
and longitude, converting the latitude and longitude into a GeoCordinate, and comparing the 
distance between all of the GeoCordinates. In addition, this app utilized logging and TDD 
to to assist with the coding process.
